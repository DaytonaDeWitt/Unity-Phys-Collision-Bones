# Unity-Phys-Collision-Bones
UPhyCB System Comes With Some Scripts For Bone Physics And Bone Collision For The Unity Engine. 

What's Included
Collider Scripts: Support for sphere, box, and plane colliders.

Dynamic Bone Scripts: Perfect for simulating physics-driven bones for cloth, hair, and garments.

Simulation Modes
This system includes two operational modes tailored for different performance and fidelity needs:

Discreet Dynamics
Optimized for runtime efficiency in larger environments. Features include off-camera bone deactivation and intelligent performance scaling for complex scenes.

High-Fidelity Dynamics
Designed for cinematic-quality results, ideal for Unity renders, promotional content, and tightly choreographed cutscenes.

Feel free to tinker, adapt, and deploy as needed.
Enjoy creatingâ€”now with a touch of physics!
